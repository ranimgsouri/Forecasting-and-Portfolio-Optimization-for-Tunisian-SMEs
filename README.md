Machine Learning-Driven Return Forecasting and Portfolio Optimization for Tunisian SMEs
This project delivers a complete data-driven framework for forecasting stock returns and optimizing portfolio allocations for Tunisian small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It was developed as part of an end-of-studies internship and focuses on bridging academic research with practical investment strategies tailored to the Tunisian market. The work begins with a robust data engineering pipeline, including manual and automated extraction of historical stock price data, data cleaning, transformation, and calculation of log returns to address skewness and ensure reliable analysis. Statistical stationarity tests (ADF, KPSS, and Phillips-Perron) were performed to assess time series properties, and autocorrelation (ACF, PACF) analyses were used to guide model selection. Multiple forecasting approaches were implemented, including classical econometric models (ARMA, GARCH, ARMA-GARCH, EGARCH) and advanced machine learning techniques (XGBoost), with systematic comparison of model performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and RÂ².

For portfolio construction, the project integrates various modern optimization strategies beyond traditional Markowitz Mean-Variance theory, including Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP), Risk Parity, and other robust allocation techniques to accommodate conservative, balanced, and aggressive investor profiles. Forecasting results are leveraged to dynamically allocate assets, simulate investment scenarios, and assess portfolio performance under different risk preferences. The solution includes clear visualization of forecasts versus actual returns, risk-return trade-offs, and allocation heatmaps for each strategy.

To enhance usability, the project features a Streamlit-based investor dashboard that provides an intuitive interface for exploring return forecasts, viewing optimization results, and comparing strategies interactively. Built entirely in Python, the project relies on libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Arch, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, and PyPortfolioOpt, ensuring scalability and reproducibility. This work contributes a practical decision-support tool that empowers investors and policymakers to make informed, data-driven decisions for SME investment and sustainable growth in the Tunisian financial market.
